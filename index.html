    <h3 id="aboutme">About Me</h3>
    <p>Tired of the same old boring webpage templates? Me too. Let me help you build your website into something unique and memorable.</p>
    <p>My name is Arystalla (pronounced “AIR-eh-STALL-uh”), and I'm an aspiring web designer and developer. I became interested in web design and development early on, when I took a class on it purely by chance as I needed to fill an elective slot. However, after the very first day, I discovered I absolutely loved it. It was a pleasant mixture of creativity and logic and it just clicked with me. For the first time in perhaps ever I finally felt like I had something that inspired me, something that I could envision as a future career I wanted to go into.</p>
    <p>At the moment I am working towards my BCS degree in Computer Science, and with any luck I will also graduate with a certificate in UX Design and a minor in Web Development. I've participated in a few internships, including one in a web design position, but I haven't managed to get any professional job experience yet. Though I do still have a lot of passion for the field and I think if given the chance, I would prove to be a quality employee.</p>

          <p>Design Tank – Instagram Landing Page</p>
        </b>
        <p>This was a page I designed for the site I worked at as an intern. They wanted an Instagram landing page, reminiscent of the popular ones made with linktree but without having to use linktree and thus being trapped within its specifications and limits. I’m fairly proud of this page because it was one of the first that I had built from scratch while I interned here, rather than just inputting data into pre-outlined pages or making adjustments to pages they already had.

          <p>Blog Page Mockup – Logo</p>
        </b>
        <p>This was a logo I designed for a page mockup in a web design class. The page was meant to be a sort of book blog with a gothic/autumnal theme, which influenced the design and colors. I’m proud of this piece because I think it looks nice and though there are a few little blemishes I would want to iron out, overall, I think it looks fairly polished and professional.</p>

          <p>Blog Page Mockup – Book Reviews</p>
        </b>
        <p>This was a page I designed as a project for a web design class. We needed to do something that utilized “cards,” so I decided to make a page that was sort of a book blog page, because books are very dear to me and it seemed like a good and unique idea. Overall, I’m proud of this page because I think it looks pretty polished and it was one of the first instances that I’d ever used CSS flexbox to adjust the page layout.</p>

          <p>Bottle Island</p>
        </b>
        <p>This piece was something I made in one of my design classes as an extra credit assignment. Though we had a tutorial to help guide us along, I’m still pretty proud of how well this piece turned out.</p>

          <p>Moonlight Silhouette – The Headless Horseman</p>
        </b>
        <p>Another piece made for a design class, we had to make a moonlit silhouette design and I chose to do mine using the outline of the headless horseman rather than an animal (bears and deer were common choices). To some degree I think I shouldn’t have done such a complex/detailed outline because it doesn’t do as well when it’s shrunk down. However, I also rather like it how it is and am pretty proud of how it turned out.</p>

          <p>Line Drawing – British Castle</p>
        </b>
        <p>One of our first assignments in my design class was to do a line drawing, this was meant to show us the importance of using general shapes to convey an idea so as not to get too caught up in the details and lose sight of the big picture. I am pretty proud of this piece because I think it came out really well and it looks fairly sleek and polished.</p>
